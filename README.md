# Image_to_PDF

## Working on:
Will convert this to an actual website with Django, the media folder is required but not included

## How it works:
Simply drag and drop the folder with images to the bat file,    
then enter the name for the pdf file when prompted.

## Requirement:
1. Have to edit the path to python interpreter from convert.bat if path is not default
2. Have to install Pillow module for the script to work

## Potential Improvement:
Add Checks to ensure only image files are converted   
Create an UI for the program
